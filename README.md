# Property_Price_Regression

This is a project to do regression analysis for real estate properties. The data for this project was given by Professor Johan Van Dorp for my class - EMSE 6765 (Fall 2022) at George Washington University.

A number of factors can be used to determine the price of a real estate property. In this report a dataset of 80 properties with 10 features is used to perform regression analysis to describe the relationship between the price and the features of the property.

We perform regression analysis to create a simple model that can explain the relationship between the dependent variable (in this case the price) and the independent variables. The aim is to create a parsimonious model with the least amount of explanatory variables while also adequately describing the variation in the
dependent variable.
